        <%= link_to "Advent of Code", "https://adventofcode.com/", target: :ext, class: "link-explicit link-external" %>
        is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day at midnight EST/UTC-5, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>,
        a new puzzle pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory 🎄
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving any puzzle earns you points 💎, not only for you, but also for <span class="strong">your campus city</span>
        @ <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> and your custom <span class="strong">squad of 4</span>.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 text-justify">
      <p>
        A puzzle is a problem defined in plain English terms, for which the answer can only be found using programming. For a given
        <span class="strong">input</span>, you need to compute the corresponding <span class="strong">output</span>, usually a number.
      </p>
      <p>A puzzle is made of two parts, two <em>challenges</em>: you access the second one only <span class="strong">if you solved the first one</span>.</p>
      <p>
        If you want to take a closer look, puzzles from previous editions are available
        <%= link_to "here", "https://adventofcode.com/events", target: :ext, class: "link-explicit link-external" %>.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 text-justify">
      <p>
        The difficulty of a puzzle varies from day to day. The first part of each puzzle is <span class="strong">largely accessible to a Wagoner, student or Alumni</span>.
        The second part is usually harder, but still accessible to more or less experienced profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the author of the puzzles attempts to <span class="strong">increase the difficulty over time, in reality it's not the case and pretty random</span>.
        You may find puzzle #20 much easier than #5. The notion of difficulty is very relative to your personal skill set and past experience with problem solving in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can always <%= link_to "discuss it", "slack://channel?team=T02NE0241&id=C02PN711H09", class: "link-explicit link-slack" %>
        with others! This event with <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> is, above all, a great opportunity
        <span class="strong">for sharing, learning and helping each other, regardless of your initial skill level</span>. It's also a perfect moment to reconnect with your city/batch 🤙

      <p>
        Because @ <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> we like things spicy, we wanted to build scoreboards <span class="strong">by campus city</span>.
        The leaderboard system on adventofcode.com is not flexible enough for that.

      <p>
        We built this platform to create a link between Kitt and Advent of Code, so we can build

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 text-justify">
      <p>
        In a nutshell, you have 24 hours to get the maximum points available for a daily puzzle.
        After that, points you can get slightly decrease over time.
      </p>

      <span class="text-center underline">Individual scores</span>

      <p>
        There are <code>50</code> <em>challenges</em> (25 days * 2 challenges per day).
        For each one of them:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>if you solve it within 24 hours, you get <code class="strong">50</code> points</li>
          <li>after 24 hours, the number of points decreases by <code class="strong">1</code> every hour</li>
          <li>it won't decrease below <code class="strong">25</code> points</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To be clear, even if you solve a challenge 2 weeks from its release, you still get <code class="strong">25</code> points.</p>
      <p>Your individual score is <span class="strong">the sum of the score for every challenge you solved</span>.</p>
      <p>
        Tiebreakers:

          <li>Total number of challenges solved in less than 24 hours</li>
          <li>Total number of challenges solved in less than 48 hours</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <span class="text-center underline">City scores</span>

      <p>Ranking cities is hard, because the number of Alumni per campus is very different.</p>
      <p>
        For <em>each challenge</em>, only the scores of your city's top contributors is taken into account.
        The number of top contributors is determined by your <span class="strong">city's size</span>: it's either
        <code class="strong">3%</code> of your city's size, or <code class="strong">10</code> contributors, whatever the <em>greatest</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            Stockholm's campus has graduated <code>51</code> Alumni. 3% of 51 is 1.53 (ceiled to <code>2</code>), thus the number of
            top contributors will be <code class="strong">10</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Berlin's campus has graduated <code>1839</code> Alumni. 3% of 1839 is 55.17 (ceiled to <code>56</code>), thus the number of
            top contributors will be <code class="strong">56</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of top contributors will be set according to the number of Alumni per city ~ a week before December,
        and will stay the same until the end of the event.
      </p>
      <p>The score of the city is <span class="strong">the average of the individual scores from its top contributors</span>.</p>
      <p>
        Examples:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            Stockholm's top contributors is set to <code>10</code>. 12 people from Stockholm take part in the event with these scores:
            <br><code>[200, 190, 170, 150, 150, 120, 110, 90, 70, 70, 50, 30]</code><br>
            Stockholm's score is the average of the 10 participants with the highest scores among the 15, so <code class="strong">132</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Berlin's top contributors is set to <code>56</code>. Only 12 people from Berlin take part in the event with these scores:
            <br><code>[200, 190, 170, 150, 150, 120, 110, 90, 70, 70, 50, 30]</code><br>
            Berlin's score is <code class="strong">25</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiebreakers:

      <span class="text-center underline">Batch scores</span>

      <p>50% of batches in 2021 had... 1 participating member.<br>78% had 3 or less.</p>
